# Earthquake Visualization

## Project Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. This project aims to help the USGS visualize earthquake data, allowing them to better educate the public and government organizations about Earth's processes and potential hazards.

## Technologies Used

- Visual Studio Code
- Leaflet
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the earthquake visualization.

## Data Source

The earthquake data used in this project is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The data is updated every minute, providing real-time information about earthquakes worldwide.

## Visualization Details

- The map displays earthquakes in the United States for the week of September 19-25, 2023.
- Each marker on the map represents an earthquake and is sized according to its magnitude.
- Marker color represents earthquake depth in meters.

## Usage

Users can interact with this visualization by clicking on earthquake markers displayed on a map. Each marker represents an earthquake that occurred within the week of September 19-25, 2023. Clicking a marker provides information about the earthquake's location and magnitude.

## Marker Size Calculation

To make earthquake markers more visible on the map, a marker size calculation was applied. The size of each marker is determined by multiplying the earthquake's magnitude by 10,000.

## Legend

A legend is located in the bottom right corner of the map. It provides a color chart indicating earthquake depth categories in meters.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to:

- Add more interactive feature and layer including information about the eath's seismic activity 
- Enhance the user interface for a richer experience.

Your contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve this project.
